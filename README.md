# TOP-EAS
The Odin Project - etch a sketch exercice

## Exercice target

- [x] Follow the instructions atop Odin’s Recipes project to set up a git repository for this project.
- [x] Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- [x] Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your html file!
- [x] It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your html).
- [x] Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- [x] Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. 
- [ ] Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Tip: 
- [ ] Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.
- [ ] Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked.
- [ ] Also check out prompts.
- [ ] You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.
- [ ] (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value.
- [ ]  Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
- [ ]  Push your project to GitHub! and add it to TOP
